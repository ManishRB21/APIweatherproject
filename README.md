# APIweatherproject
Using Express to Render a Website with Live API Data. Here, I've used a free API called Open weather. The aim here is to display weather of different cities (over 200,000), on just one click to the server, which fetches details using Open Weather API and display the weather details. You can add CSS/Bootstrap to add style, I've emphasized more over the backend part of the website.
